What is an UI?
--------------

UIS are an interface between FoxGame and the users. They are placed in
./foxgame/UI/ and are dinamically loaded with the "-i GUI" option.

e.g.
 ./main -i bubbles
           ^
        "bubbles" gui: foxgame.UI.bubbles module.

Currently, 2 uis are avaible:
 - bubbles: user-friendly interface, written using pygame;
 - simulator: benchmark/testing interface,

How are UIs structured?
