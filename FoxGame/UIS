What is an UI?
--------------

UIS are an interface between FoxGame and the users. They are placed in
./foxgame/UI/ and are dinamically loaded with the "-i GUI" option.

e.g.
 ./main -i bubbles
           ^
        "bubbles" gui: foxgame.UI.bubbles module.

Currently, 2 uis are avaible:
 - bubbles: user-friendly interface, written using pygame;
 - simulator: benchmark/testing interface,


How are UIs structured?
-----------------------

The ./main file, after loading Controllers, launchs a main() function who
handles the main loop of the game.

    gamecore
    --------

    gamecore.py provides a objects like Fox, Hare and Carrot, but also a class
    Game. gamecore.Game has all you need to set up a basical game physics: time
    elapsed, collisions, moves, etc.

    See foxgame/UI/simulator.py and help(foxgame.gamecore.Game) for more
    informations.

    extraoptions
    ------------

    Like brains, for UIs also there are extraoptions avaible.

    e.g.
    I need to test the Brain I've just finished for the hare, and see its
    performance in 10,000 games.

    $ ./main -i simulator games:10000 --hare-b=<mybrain>
                            ^
                        UI extraoption
