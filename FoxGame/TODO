# 1. Create the basic framework
- recycle old code, fitting to this new structure (described in DESIGN file) -
    : check whether classes like BasicGame, BasicFox, etc. are correct
    : check whether pygame.Game class is correct
    : write the main function for the pygame interface
    : check whethr main file can cantrol each possible feature in the game
- write pygamei using pygame.Sprite class for the fox and the hare           -
- code pre/post filters and controllers                                      -
    : follow DESIGN file.
- write lots and lots of tests, about physis of game                         -
    : write tests foreach function
- code nulli for a "void" interface
    : allow simple output, for displaying some informations
- improve documentation                                                      -
    : avoid nonsensical docstrings
    : explain and re-write sentences in bad-english
- make a new ncurses interface
    : follow pygame file


# 2. Make algorithms
Make some libs, with related functions whitch uses the following approaches:
   - traditional meccanic library (tradlib)   - Ed and maker
   - fuzzy logic library          (fuzzylib)  - maker
   - neuralnetwork library        (annlib)    - Ota and maker
   - q-learn library              (qlearnlib) - il_sorcio
   - genetic algorithm library    (gaslib)    - il_sorcio
