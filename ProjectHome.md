# FoxGame! #
**FoxGame** is an open source videogame with simple mechanics and easily pluggable [AI modules](Brains.md). The main purpose of the project is to provide a sandbox where to experiment with artificial intelligence, machine learning and control techniques.

The game features simple 2d graphics. In this 2d universe, a fox has to chase a running hare, which in turn can get carrots on the field. The goal of the developer is to build a successful brain for the animals on the field: either a foxy fox capable of quickly jump on the hare, or a clever hare that leverages its quick running legs to survive and eat its beloved carrots.
